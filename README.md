# MeshWarrior

WARNING: As of now, this is a failed project, and needs me to revisit it again some day.

MeshWarrior is a C++ library of code designed to support various operations on 3D meshes.  Current features include...

* Saving/loading to/from Wavefront OBJ file format.
* The union, intersection and difference of meshes.

Following are two snapshots of 3DS Max showing the results of taking the union, intersection, and difference of a sphere and a box.
